The Dot Voting app is used to participate in multi-option dot votes, where each voter has 100 dots that can be distributed across each option. The voting weight will be determined by multiplying the voterâ€™s token balance at the time the proposal opened by the number of dots for the option. The outcome (e.g. top ranked options) is based on the average voting weight received per option.

The Dot Voting app currently supports financial proposals from the Allocations app and issue curation proposals from the Projects app.

## Features
- Participate in the allocation of funds from proposals originating from the Allocations app.
- Distribute allocations dynamically, based on the results of the dot vote.
- Participate in votes for curating GitHub issues from the Projects app.
