The Vault app is used to store an organization's financial assets. Other apps, such as the Finance app, can be given permission to access and manage the assets held by the Vault, enabling seamless transactions across apps.

**WARNING**  
Users should be cautious about which entities have permission to transfer assets from the Vault. Setting the wrong permission could lead to an irreversible loss of assets. Review the permissions set in the Vault app carefully before depositing a significant amount of valuable assets in the Vault.
