The Disputable Voting app is used to create and participate in votes. Votes can be linked to an action, such as issuing a new token or transferring funds, or be purely informative, and can be disputed if their purpose does not adhere to a linked Aragon Agreement.

## Features
- Create a new informative vote.
- Vote "yes" or "no" on open votes.
- Challenge open votes and raise disputes to an arbitrator like Aragon Court
- See details about open and past votes, including how many tokens have voted and how much time is left before a vote is over.
- Give the Voting app permission to perform actions in other apps so those actions have to be approved by a holder vote before they can be executed.
