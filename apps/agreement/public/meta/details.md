Agreements are how organizations can have a subjective set of rules, that cannot be encoded into smart contracts, to govern any type of action 
that people can perform. This will be the bridge between DAOs and Aragon Court, allowing DAOs to be turned into optimistic organizations where 
every action can be easily executed and challenged exceptionally, instead of forcing each user to go through a tedious approval process every 
time they want to perform an action.
