The Tokens app is used to manage the supply and distribution of an organization's token. Each installation of the Tokens app manages only one token. Tokens can be used to give different types of powers or rights to members of an organization, such as the power to vote on proposals or the right to receive a share of the organization's profits.

## Features
- Issue new tokens and remove existing tokens.
- Browse a list of all tokenholders and see how tokens are distributed among them.
- Get an at-a-glance view of stats about the token, such as the token name and ticker symbol, the total supply, and whether or not the token is transferable.
