Similar to the standard voting app, the Dandelion voting app is used to create and participate in votes. However, the Dandelion voting app has additional functionality to enable an Organization to restrict voters from performing action using the Aragon permissions system if the user has contributed to a vote passing, until that vote has been enacted.

## Features

- See details about open and past votes, including how many tokens have voted and how much time is left before a vote is over.
- Give users permission to perform actions within the organization based on whether or not the user has voted yes in a pending vote.
- Add a delay period after a vote is approved but before it can be executed.
- Give the Voting app permission to perform actions in other apps so those actions have to be approved by a tokenholder vote before they can be executed.
