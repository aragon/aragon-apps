Aragon Agent is a fully-fledged Ethereum account owned by an Aragon organization. It's like a multi-signature account on steroids that enables organizations to interact with any Ethereum contract or protocol. This means it can be thought of as the external interface of a DAO.

## WARNING
Users should be cautious about which entities have permission to execute actions and transfer assets from the Agent. Setting the wrong permission could lead to an irreversible loss of assets. Review the permissions set in the Agent app carefully before depositing a significant amount of valuable assets in the Agent.
