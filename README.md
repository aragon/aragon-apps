## Apps

This monorepo contains the following apps:

- **[Agent](apps/agent)**: Hold assets and perform actions from Aragon organizations.
- **[Agreement](apps/agreement)**: Govern organizations through a subjective rules.
- **[Finance](apps/finance)**: Send payments and manage expenses with budgeting.
- **[Tokens](apps/token-manager)**: Manages an organization's token supply and distribution.
- **[Vault](apps/vault)**: Securely owns and manages tokens on behalf of a DAO.
- **[Voting](apps/voting)**: Create votes that execute actions on behalf of token holders.
- **[Disputable Voting](apps/voting-disputable)**: Create disputable votes that execute actions on behalf of token holders.

Each of the individual apps come with a frontend that is intended to be installed and used through the [Aragon client](http://github.com/aragon/aragon).

You can read more about how each of the individual apps work in the [Aragon user guide](https://help.aragon.org/article/16-about-aragon-apps).

## Quick start

`aragon-apps` uses [`yarn workspaces`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) and [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage its individual app workspaces.

To bootstrap, simply run:

```
yarn
```

This will initialize and install each of the individual apps, hoisting their shared dependencies into the root `node_modules/` directory.

> üí° If you're only interested in bootstrapping one package, you can go to that specific package workspace and use `yarn install --focus`

#### Smart contracts

Running tests on all apps can be done by running `yarn test` at the root directory (note that this can take a significant amount of time!).

Running tests of an individual app can be done by running `yarn test`¬†inside an individual app's directory, or through the selective `yarn test:<app>` scripts.

By default, tests are run on an in-memory instance of testrpc.

#### Frontends

Each app's frontend is encapsulated inside of that app's own `app/` directory.

To work on frontend, you'll need to go into `app/` directory and do another `yarn` installation. For more instructions, you can follow the ["Frontend Setup" guide in the Aragon client](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/blob/master/docs/FRONTEND_SETUP.md). Note that the app itself doesn't need to be bootstrapped if you'd just like to install the frontend.

For example:

```sh
# Starting at this project's root
# Go to the Voting app's directory
cd apps/voting

# Go to the Voting app's frontend directory
cd app/

# Install and start
yarn
yarn start
```
