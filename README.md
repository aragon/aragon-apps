# Aragon Apps <img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aragon/design/master/readme-logo.png" height="80px" /> [![Travis branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/aragon/aragon-apps/master.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://travis-ci.com/aragon/aragon-apps) [![Coveralls branch](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/aragon/aragon-apps/master.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://coveralls.io/github/aragon/aragon-apps)

## Apps

This repository contains the following apps:

- **[Finance](apps/finance)**: Send payments and manage expenses with budgeting.
- **[Survey](apps/survey)**: Create polls to gauge community opinions.
- **[Tokens](apps/token-manager)**: Manages organization tokens.
- **[Vault](apps/vault)**: Securely owns and manages tokens on behalf of a DAO.
- **[Voting](apps/voting)**: Create votes that execute actions on behalf of token holders.

Each of the individual apps come with a frontend that is intended to be installed and used through the [Aragon client](http://github.com/aragon/aragon).

You can read more about how each of the individual apps work in the [Aragon user guide](https://help.aragon.org/category/15-aragon-apps).

## Coming soon apps

The following apps are still under development, and not ready for production deployment yet:

- **[Payroll](future-apps/payroll)**: Manages employees' payrolls.

## Quick start

```
npm install
```

This installs global package dependencies and also bootstraps the entire monorepo through [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

> **Note**: the monorepo is set up in such a way that you **must** install it through a `lerna bootstrap` (done automatically after an `npm install`).
>
> If you're only interested in the contract dependencies, and not the frontends, you can use `INSTALL_FRONTEND=false npm install` instead.
>
> If you're only interested in bootstrapping one package, you can use `npx lerna bootstrap --scope @aragon/<package> --include-filtered-dependencies`

Running tests on all apps can be done by running `npm run test` at the root directory (note that running all of the tests can take a significant amount of time!).

Running tests of an individual app can be done by running `npm run test`¬†inside an individual app's directory, or through the selective `npm run test:<app>` scripts.

By default, tests are run on an in-memory instance of testrpc.
