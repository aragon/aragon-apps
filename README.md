You can read more about how the individual apps work in the [Aragon user guide](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#3-aragon-apps).

## Coming soon apps

The following apps are still under development, not ready for production deployment yet:

- **[Payroll](future-apps/payroll)**: Manages employees' payrolls.

## Developing

```
npm install
```

This installs global package dependencies and also bootstraps lerna packages.

Running tests on all apps can be done running `npm run test` at the root directory. Running tests of an individual app can be done by running `npm run test`Â inside the app directory.

By default tests are run in a in-memory instance of testrpc.
