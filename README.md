- **[Payroll](future-apps/payroll)**: Manages employees' payrolls.
- **[Fundraising](future-apps/fundraising)**: Manages fundraising campaings.

## Developing

```
npm install
```

This installs global package dependencies and also bootstraps lerna packages.

Running tests on all apps can be done running `npm run test` at the root directory. Running tests of an individual app can be done by running `npm run test`Â inside the app directory.

By default tests are run in a in-memory instance of testrpc.
